B722	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		grotto beach	San Salvador			+AHs-Hattin1989+AH0- contains an excellent description and interpretation of this outcrop. As you walk down to the Grotto Beach, the outcrop is immediately to your right and stretches across the Grotto. Immediatly adjcant to the beach is a paleo+AC0-patch reef containing Porites astreoides, Psuedodiploria sp. and Montastrea sp.. Around 2.5 m above MSL these framework corals are capped by a thin layer (10+AC0-20 cm) of corraline red algae (Neogoniolithon Strictum). Above, there are 1.5 meters of cross and very poorly sorted (medium to pebble sized) angular carbonate sand. This sand unit is capped by intermittent breccia intra+AC0-clasts where it transitions upwards into well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. These nearly parallel+AC0-bedded sands persist up to at least 5.8 meters where bedding becomes difficult to discern. The upper+AC0-most sediments here have abundant root+AC0-casts and are mostly very fine sand (presumably aeolian).

B729	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		pirate steps	New Providence			This easy+AC0-access unit is described in detail by +AHs-Aurell1995+AH0- and many others +AHs-Garrett1984,Ball1967,Strasser1986+AH0-. Our interpretations and observations of the geology at this site match past studies. Exposed along the cliffs of the southwest corner of New Providence Island, you can find excellent exposures of a last interglacial shallowing+AC0-upwards parasequence. The lower 2.5 m contain large (+AD4-50 cm) scale trough+AC0-cross stratification and intra+AC0-clast breccia blocks (roughly 50 cm diameter). The intra+AC0-clasts disappear and the cross bed scale decreases slightly up to about meter 4.5 where the cross stratification transitions into 10+AC0-20 cm tabular cross beds. There are some tabular clasts that mark the upwards transition from this unit into roughly 2 meters of well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. The outcrop is capped by very fine sand that has abundant fossilized root+AC0-casts.
B801	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		boat cove	West Caicos			This location has been described in +AHs-Kerans2019+AH0-. The outcrop is part of a massive exposure of a LIG reef that spans most of West Caicos island. At this location, the lowermost 2 m is a heavily recrystallized framework of in+AC0-situ corals (+AHs-Acrapora Palmata+AH0- and +AHs-Psuedodiploria sp.+AH0-). Those corals are capped by 2 m of large+AC0-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and abundant +AFw-emph+AHs-Ophiomorpha+AH0- trace fossils (likely shrimp burrows). This cross stratified unit sharply transitions upwards into +AH4-1 m of well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. The ocean+AC0-ward ends of these nearly parallel beds often contain tabular breccia blocks of the same unit (presumably ancient beach rock breccia). This unit is capped with intermittently spaced (10+AC0-20 meter) large breccia+AC0-filled +AGA-flower+AC0-pots'. These features are 1+AC0-2 meter diameter round bowl+AC0-shaped depressions carved downward into the subplanar beds. The contact and fill material is bright red limestone that contains clasts of recrystallized grey or black limestone. These features may indicate the past location of large plants or palm trees.

B815	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		matthews town strandplain	Great Inagua			 A more detailed description of this geology can be found in +AHs-White1987+AH0-. This unit is easily observed across the street from the baseball field in central Matthew Town. The lowermost meter contains abundant large+AC0-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and +AHs-Ophiomorpha+AH0- trace fossils. There is an irregular contact between this cross bedded unit and overlying well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. The top of this well+AC0-sorted unit contains a 5+AC0-8 cm thick cap that is best characterized by pervasive irregular cm+AC0-scale macro+AC0-porosity. This unit has been interpreted as a wrack+AC0-line or plant accumulation layer at the contact between beach and dunes +AHs-White1987+AH0-. The upper+AC0-most rocks in this location contain very fine sand, and are full of fossilized root+AC0-casts.

B1107							8 mile bight	Crooked Island			Walking south along the rock coastline from Landrail Point you will come across a small sandy pocket beach after about 1 km. Beyond that beach, the next 4.5 km of coastline contain outcrop of a last interglacial progradation strandplain. The lower 3 m contain large+AC0-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and abundant +AHs-Ophiomorpha+AH0- trace fossils (likely shrimp burrows). This lower unit contains occasional thumb+AC0-sized coral fragments (+AHs-Siderastrea Radians+AH0-). There is an irregular and gradual contact between this lower unit and +AH4- 2 m of well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. The upper+AC0-most part of this unit contains extremely well preserved spherical beach fenestrae (the remnants of air escaping when waves crashed on the ancient beach). Above this fenestrae+AC0-bearing unit, there are large meter scale fossilized aeolinite dunes. The dune height varies along the 4.5 km coastal outcrop from half a meter to more than 3 meters.

B1112	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Long Cay Reef	Crooked Island			At this location, the lowermost 2 m consists of a dense framework of in+AC0-situ corals that are characteristic of a reef crest. These corals are capped by a shallowing+AC0-upwards sequence of cross stratified sand, subplanar sand, and meter scale aeolian dunes.

B1123	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		long reef	Long Island			Head east from Anderson's settlement on Long Island towards the coastal cliffs. Near the cliffs, you will come to a T junction. Park near this junction and scrable down to the rocks near the water. As you head north you will cross fossilized aeolian dunes for about 1 km. After a small pocket beach, the outcrop will transition into a 400 m long last interglacial fossil reef. On the northern end of this reef, the coastline bends inward, and around that bend you will find a 3 m high shallowing+AC0-upwards parasequence. The lower meter contains large+AC0-scale (50 cm) cross stratification. The contact between this lower unit and the overlying unit is difficult to pinpoint. The overlying unit contains well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline, and the upper+AC0-most beds in this unit contain well preserved spherical beach fenestrae (the remnants of air escaping when waves crashed on the ancient beach).
